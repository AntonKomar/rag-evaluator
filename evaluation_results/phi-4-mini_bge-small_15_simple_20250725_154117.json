Additionally, they receive an official transcript or diploma from the University acknowledging that they've completed all requirements for graduation in accordance with \u00a720 Requirements and procedure for admission to the master\u2019s thesis.\n\nHowever, it should be noted there is no specific mention of a document being issued upon request after successfully completing the master's examination within these excerpts; typically such documents would include an official transcript or diploma. If you need more detailed information on what exactly can be requested following successful completion beyond what's provided here (such as certificates for individual modules), this may not have been covered in your given context, and it might require direct inquiry with the University of Passau's Examinations Office.\n\nIf there is a specific document or type of recognition you are referring to that isn't mentioned above due to missing information from other sections beyond what was provided here (e.g., certificates for individual modules), please let me know so I can attempt further assistance.",

Additionally, if there was no intention to deceive initially but later found out otherwise after obtaining admission through deceitful means (\u00a715(2)), this could lead to revocation decisions in compliance with administrative law principles.\n\nIn cases where a candidate cheats during an examination and it is discovered afterward (as per \u00a713), the affected assessment will be awarded either \"nicht ausreichend\" or \"nicht bestanden,\" depending on whether it's insufficient work (\"5.0\") or outright failure, respectively. The incorrect transcript must also be revoked if necessary to issue new ones.\n\nIn summary:\n- Retroactive correction of grades and declaration that examination was failed in whole or part.\n- Revocation decisions for deceitful admission after initial pass marks are awarded (if no intention to deceive initially).\n- Awarding \"nicht ausreichend\" (\"5.0\") or \"nicht bestanden,\" revoking the incorrect transcript, if cheating is discovered during an exam.\n\nThe Board of Examiners must also ensure candidates have been heard before making any decisions (\u00a715(3)).",
