It also studies different preference models, preference query languages, algebraic and cost-based preference query optimization, and algorithms for evaluating preferences.\n\nIn terms of algorithms covered in the course, it likely included a range of topics such as:\n\n1. Preference query optimization: This involves developing algorithms to optimize preference queries in database systems, including algebraic and cost-based methods.\n2. Preference evaluation algorithms: These are used to evaluate preferences in various contexts, such as personalization, recommendation systems, and information retrieval.\n3. Preference-based search algorithms: These are designed to retrieve relevant documents based on user preferences, such as relevance, diversity, and novelty.\n4. Preference-aware database management systems: These are designed to handle complex queries that take into account user preferences, such as SQL-like languages for preference queries.\n5. Preference-based information retrieval models: These are used to evaluate the relevance of documents based on user preferences, such as the Skyline algorithm and its variants.\n\nThese are just some examples of the algorithms covered in a course on Preference-Based Information Retrieval. The specific topics and focus of the course may have varied depending on the instructor and the particular offering of the course.",
